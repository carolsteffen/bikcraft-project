<h1 align="center">Hello! :metal:</h1>

<samp> Here, I'm studying about web design and front-end basic technologies (HTML, CSS, JS), but a bit of PHP too. </samp> 
<samp> How am I learning? Yeah, girl, I'm learning about it with a Origamid's course called "web design" and I have 
somethings to say about it: :point_down:</samp>

____________________________________________


<samp> :lemon: I will use the variable names until the end of the course, and after I finish, I will change their names and classes, 
id's, and others. I will leave as I would, but I need time. :nail_care: </samp>
